# Opendoors

opendoors is a fully packaged Drupal distribution for projects in citizen
participation, providing a questions&answers platform.

We recommend to use opendoors as a responsive tool that, together with public
information available online, creates transparency. Opendoors supports an open
participatory culture in the public, with customers and within organisations.
It's just as executive managers sometimes leave their office door open to invite employees
to come up with question any time.

There's a [Demo site][demo-site-link].
